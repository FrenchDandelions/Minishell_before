start of the list

if list is nothing but skip, return

check if there's no parsiing errors(quotes closed, parenthesis closed, no pipe at the beginning alone,
neither at the end)

get size of the first word as long as it isn't a wildcard, a redirection or a pipe

how to check the wildcard?

either there's soemthing before the wildcard, after the wildcard, both or neither

so i have to check the token before and after the wildcard

if the token before is arg, i checkthe next one, an i the next one is arg i keep going with the size

if token before is skip, size should be = 0, so i check if the next one is an arg

if it is I keep going, else TK_wilcard alone, i need new define

else, if there is something before, token will be TK_wildcard_pref

else if there's nothing before but there's after, then TK_wildcard_suf

else if both, TK_wildcard_both

4 different behaviors

now redirections

if >> it should append the command to the file, so outfile what's next to it

if there's nothing it's an error

same with input redirection

the syntax is ALWAYS:

command options(if any) redirection(if any) file(if any)

if no redirection, input/output is stdin/stdout

if no file, file input is stdin and file output is stdout

options always start with -, if not they're considered files

for the pattern matching, we'll just put the argument that'll be at the end, which isn't an option, 

if it fails then it wasn't a pattern but a file, so you pass it as an outfile in a new execve

it it still fails then it the problem is from the command itself so it'll be the message error that

leo showed.

in the first case the outfile is always guessed as the stdout
